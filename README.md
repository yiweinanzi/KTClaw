## Overview

**KTClaw** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience—no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, KTClaw provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

KTClaw comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. Of course, you can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

## Why KTClaw

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. KTClaw was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.**

| Challenge | KTClaw Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic gateway lifecycle management |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Built-in skill marketplace and management |

### OpenClaw Inside

KTClaw is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application to provide a seamless "battery-included" experience.

We are committed to maintaining strict alignment with the upstream OpenClaw project, ensuring that you always have access to the latest capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility provided by the official releases.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier
Complete the entire setup—from installation to your first AI interaction—through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, no YAML files, no environment variable hunting.

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. Support for multiple conversation contexts, message history, rich content rendering with Markdown, and direct `@agent` routing in the main composer for multi-agent setups.
When you target another agent with `@agent`, KTClaw switches into that agent's own conversation context directly instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, and stronger isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.
The chat composer also includes slash commands such as `/new`, `/stop`, `/agent`, `/cwd`, `/memory`, `/cron`, `/settings`, and `/export` for fast local actions without leaving the keyboard.
Sidebar search is available from the search entry or `Ctrl/Cmd+K`, and now searches sessions, agents, pages, and cached chat-history text. Sessions can be pinned in the Sidebar, exported from the session/agent context menus or `/export`, and managed from the Chat page's `Session` drawer. The Activity page also upgrades raw logs into filterable structured event cards with raw-line expansion and live auto-refresh.

### 🧪 Rich Markdown Rendering
Chat markdown now covers standard math rendering and KaTeX `mhchem` chemistry formulas, alongside syntax highlighting, local file links, and copy-friendly code blocks.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Management
Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.
Feishu onboarding now stays inside KTClaw with one integrated wizard for plugin checks, robot create/link handoff, credential save, app-scope recovery, and QR-based user authorization.

### ⏰ Cron-Based Automation
Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers, set intervals, and let your AI agents work around the clock without manual intervention.
The Cron page also includes richer run-detail panels with delivery targets, recent error context, and recent run history.
Agent detail pages now expose backend-owned cron relations and deep-link directly into the relevant Cron pipeline entry.

### 👥 Team Control Plane (MVP)
KTClaw now treats team pages as role-aware control surfaces instead of static member lists.
In `Agent Detail`, each member can be configured with `teamRole` (`leader` or `worker`), `chatAccess` (`direct` or `leader_only`), and `responsibility`.
`leader_only` is now enforced for normal direct-chat entry paths in the workbench: users are expected to route requests through the reporting leader instead of opening a direct worker chat.
Team pages also surface user-facing channel ownership and lightweight work visibility derived from the existing kanban/runtime model, so you can see who owns entry points and which members are blocked, waiting, or actively executing work.
`Team Overview` and `Team Map` now surface these semantics alongside runtime activity cues, so you can quickly identify who coordinates, who executes, and which members should be reached through leaders.
Phase 4 extends that control plane with a leader-first progress briefing in Team Overview, richer collaboration-aware Team Map nodes and drawers, and a lightweight Team Brief panel in private leader chat for quick navigation back into member detail and Kanban.
Phase 5 then refines those surfaces into a warmer leader command center: Team Overview prioritizes progress, active work, risks, and next-step guidance, while Team Map becomes a denser operations topology with a persistent task-focused rail.

### 🧩 Extensible Skill System
Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. Browse, install, and manage skills through the integrated skill panel—no package managers required.
KTClaw also pre-bundles full document-processing skills (`pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`), deploys them automatically to the managed skills directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup, and enables them by default on first install. Additional bundled skills (`find-skills`, `self-improving-agent`, `tavily-search`, `brave-web-search`, `bocha-skill`) are also enabled by default; if required API keys are missing, OpenClaw will surface configuration errors in runtime.  
The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources (managed dir, workspace, and extra skill dirs), and now shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly.

Environment variables for bundled search skills:
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` for `brave-web-search`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` for `tavily-search` (OAuth may also be supported by upstream skill runtime)
- `BOCHA_API_KEY` for `bocha-skill`
- `find-skills` and `self-improving-agent` do not require API keys

### 🔐 Secure Provider Integration
Connect to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more) with credentials stored securely in your system's native keychain. OpenAI supports both API key and browser OAuth (Codex subscription) sign-in.

### 🌙 Adaptive Theming
Light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes. KTClaw adapts to your preferences automatically.

### 🚀 Startup Launch Control
In **Settings → General**, you can enable **Launch at system startup** so KTClaw starts automatically after login.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/KTClaw/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/KTClaw.git
cd KTClaw

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```
### First Launch

When you launch KTClaw for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** – Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** – Add providers with API keys or OAuth (for providers that support browser/device login)
3. **Skill Bundles** – Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** – Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Note for Moonshot (Kimi): KTClaw keeps Kimi web search enabled by default.  
> When Moonshot is configured, KTClaw also syncs Kimi web search to the China endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) in OpenClaw config.

### Proxy Settings

KTClaw includes built-in proxy settings for environments where Electron, the OpenClaw Gateway, or channels such as Telegram need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings → Gateway → Proxy** and configure:

- **Proxy Server**: the default proxy for all requests
- **Bypass Rules**: hosts that should connect directly, separated by semicolons, commas, or new lines
- In **Developer Mode**, you can optionally override:
  - **HTTP Proxy**
  - **HTTPS Proxy**
  - **ALL_PROXY / SOCKS**

Recommended local examples:

```text
Proxy Server: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```
Notes:

- A bare `host:port` value is treated as HTTP.
- If advanced proxy fields are left empty, KTClaw falls back to `Proxy Server`.
- Saving proxy settings reapplies Electron networking immediately and restarts the Gateway automatically.
- KTClaw also syncs the proxy to OpenClaw's Telegram channel config when Telegram is enabled.
- In **Settings → Advanced → Developer**, you can run **OpenClaw Doctor** to execute `openclaw doctor --json` and inspect the diagnostic output without leaving the app.

## Architecture

KTClaw employs a **dual-process architecture** with a unified host API layer. The renderer talks to a single client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection and process lifecycle:

### Design Principles

- **Process Isolation**: The AI runtime operates in a separate process, ensuring UI responsiveness even during heavy computation
- **Single Entry for Frontend Calls**: Renderer requests go through host-api/api-client; protocol details are hidden behind a stable interface
- **Main-Process Transport Ownership**: Electron Main controls WS/HTTP usage and fallback to IPC for reliability
- **Graceful Recovery**: Built-in reconnect, timeout, and backoff logic handles transient failures automatically
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and sensitive data leverage the operating system's native secure storage mechanisms
- **CORS-Safe by Design**: Local HTTP access is proxied by Main, preventing renderer-side CORS issues

pnpm package:linux:ci     # CI package for Linux (no publish)
pnpm run governance:check # Run knip + dependency-cruiser governance checks
```

### Communication Regression Checks

When a PR changes communication paths (gateway events, chat runtime send/receive flow, channel delivery, or transport fallback), run:

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

`comms-regression` in CI enforces required scenarios and threshold checks.

### Accessibility & Governance Gates

When a change touches shared UI, renderer accessibility, or module boundaries, run the focused gates before pushing:

```bash
pnpm run lint:a11y
pnpm run test:a11y
pnpm run governance:check
```

`lint:a11y` currently covers the Activity, Cron, Settings, and Workbench empty-state surfaces. `test:a11y` runs the matching `vitest-axe` regressions, and `governance:check` combines `knip` with `dependency-cruiser` boundary checks.

### Codex Ralph Loop

For long-running autonomous iteration with Codex, the repository now includes a Ralph-compatible loop under `scripts/ralph/`.

Required files:

- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.mjs`
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh`
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.ps1`
- `scripts/ralph/CODEX.md`
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json.example`
- repository-root `prd.json`

Example commands:

```bash
pnpm run ralph:codex -- 999
bash ./scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh 999
bash ./scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh --forever
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ralph\ralph-codex.ps1 999
```

The loop calls `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` internally and stops early once the agent emits `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`.
